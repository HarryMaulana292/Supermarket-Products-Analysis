# Supermarket-Products-Analysis

## About Dataset
This dataset is a customer personality dataset owned by supermarkets from 2012 - 2014. This dataset is divided into 4 categories, which includes customer data, products purchased, promotions taken, and platforms used.

Based on the research conducted, it was found that this dataset was uploaded by Akash Patel (a teacher in Texas) on Kaggle[[1]](https://time.com/6179344/akash-patel-innovative-teachers-2022/). Therefore, it will be assumed that this dataset is the dataset of one of the supermarkets in Texas. The things that will be able to support this assumption will be explained in the analysis section.

## Background
A supermarket in Texas sells several types of products, namely wine, meat, fish, fruit, sweet and gold products. This supermarket has been collecting data on its customers from 2012 to 2014 and wants to evaluate the sales level of products for the past 3 years.

## Problem Statement
The Purchasing Manager/Procurement Manager of a supermarket wants to know which products are selling effectively so that the supermarket can further maximize its profits.

## Conclusion
The following is a summary of each conclusion from the previous analysis.

1. Based on the Total Sales Data of each product, we can see that the sales of **Fish** products are lower than the sales of **Meat** products. This is because texas geographically its water area is only about 2.7% when compared to its land area (97.3)[[2]](https://www.infoplease.com/us/states/land-and-water-area-of-states). Because of this, the only people in Texas who have a high interest in fish products are those in coastal Texas cities such as [Galveston](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.southernliving.com%2Ftravel%2Ftexas%2Fwhats-new-in-galveston&psig=AOvVaw2r-2J7pErJiwsU0ZMHK5SN&ust=1684091720391000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CBEQjRxqFwoTCJjK_taA8_4CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE), [Corpus Christi](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftotallytexastravel.com%2Fthings-to-do-in-corpus-christi%2F&psig=AOvVaw3g0HCJIYmFUkKUfDNtB0P4&ust=1684091775945000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CBEQjRxqFwoTCOCZ3_GA8_4CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAR), and [Port Aransas](https://www.google.com/search?q=Port+Aransas&source=lmns&bih=706&biw=1536&rlz=1C1GCEA_enID973ID973&hl=id&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjnh-Ky__L-AhV_AbcAHfnuBDsQ_AUoAHoECAEQAA). As for residents who are far from the beach or coastal area, the interest in fish products is not as great as those who live near the the coast due to the lack of accessibility to be able to get fresh fish products. Therefore, they choose other products such as meat.
1. Texans' interest in **wine** products is high. This is because Texas has a diverse climate and good soil conditions that have the potential to grow quality grapes[[3]](https://www.reddyvineyards.com/blog/wine-and-grape-growers-in-west-texas-high-plains-ava/). Besides that, there are some famous wine regions in Texas such as [Hill Country](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.decanter.com%2Fwine-travel%2Ftexas-hill-country-for-winelovers-the-places-to-know-472115%2F&psig=AOvVaw0ebWgWbsXkYy81VxitFRlC&ust=1684092518950000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=2ahUKEwiXjZTUg_P-AhWlXmwGHdTkAKQQjRx6BAgAEAw), [Fredericksburg](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viator.com%2Ftours%2FFredericksburg%2FFredericksburg-Hill-Country-Wine-Tour%2Fd50796-34335P1&psig=AOvVaw0UCWgrgUCbOmF6dI-tsLFN&ust=1684092514199000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=2ahUKEwjjiPLRg_P-AhXeXmwGHd1MC5gQjRx6BAgAEAw) and [Texas Plains](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.decanter.com%2Fpremium%2Ftexas-high-plains-ava-profile-plus-10-exciting-wines-to-try-490864%2F&psig=AOvVaw0acImiPtu57QtbrMW1rAX5&ust=1684092662236000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CBEQjRxqFwoTCMiunpiE8_4CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE) which attracts many tourists each year. Wine-themed festivals and events in the area are held almost year-round, further increasing Texans' interest in wine. 
1. **Gold** is not a product that is needed to be consumed every day like meat, fish and others. Customers only buy gold at certain times or circumstances such as when they have excess funds and want to invest them by buying gold. So for the sales figures of gold is fairly reasonable and difficult if you want to increase.
1. Based on the data, it can be seen that most supermarket customers are married. Then in second place are customers who are still single. By knowing the number of customers in terms of marital status, we can strategize what products are most in demand by both marital status categories so that it can further increase product sales from the supermarket itself.
1. Although Gen X is the first largest generation and baby boomers are the second largest generation, it doesn't mean that we should focus on the products that Gen X and baby boomers are most interested in. We still have to consider how the supermarket can survive in the future. Therefore, supermarkets should focus on products that are most in demand by the millennial generation so that the total millennial customers of supermarkets can increase. Even if necessary, supermarkets can also design and prepare products for the next Gen Z generation.

## Recommendation
### Strategies to increase sales of the current products.
**Fish**

* If you want to increase sales of fish products, supermarkets can target certain events in Texas. There are several events or festivals that adopt the ocean theme such as [Texas Seafood Festival](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.texasrealfood.com%2Fevents%2Fthe-port-isabel-shrimp-cook-off-seafood-festival-2022%2F&psig=AOvVaw0duo3g2UxqwJjQZF_0rLM2&ust=1684093159160000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CBEQjRxqFwoTCKikvoWG8_4CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE) and several other festivals.

**Sweet**
* As for sweet products, this can be done by bundling with wine products which are the most popular products. This is because wine and sweet products are one of the menus that are often served during formal occasions such as weddings, business events, and other formal occasions. That way, sweet sales can also be increased.

**Fruit**
* As for fruit products, we can bundle them with meat products. This is because both products have continuity in terms of nutrition. Meat can provide the protein needed by the body while fruit can provide vitamin and mineral in the body.

### Product procurement strategy to attract more customers.

* Since the majority of supermarket customers are married, there are several product suggestions that have the opportunity to attract customers while increasing profits. These products are household appliances and health products. This is because married people will tend to need household appliances. In addition, both those who are single and those who are married and have children or even in general will always need health products.
*  Some products that are generally in demand by millennials are technology products such as smartphones, laptops, and accessories as well as several other technology products. This is because millennials are a generation that cannot be separated from technology. Without using technology, this generation will be hampered in carrying out their activities and will find it difficult to develop. So the type of technology product is the right choice if you want to attract millennial customers.
